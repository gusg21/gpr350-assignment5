# Starting Project

Start your project by creating a **private** template from this
repository: <https://github.com/GPR-350-101/assignment5>. Remember to:

1.  Make your repository **private**
2.  Add me as a collaborator
3.  There are no unit tests, so no need to set GitHub secrets


# Goal

Switch assignment 4 to 3D.


# Grading

Grades will be based on the criteria in the PDF. Particles colliding between them and with the 6 planes will grant you the 24 points. NO ADDITIONAL POINTS FOR CREATIVITY.
1.  Spawning the 3D particle and it moves with the integrator : 8 pts
2.  Collisions between them : 8 pts
3.  Collisions with the surrounding 6 walls : 8 pts
